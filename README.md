Getting and Cleaning Data peer assessment
------------------------------------------

This is my submission. It requires very little setup. Run it anywhere; if there is no "UCI HAR Dataset" in your working directory, the script will take care of downloading the zip file and unzipping it (and will delete the zip file to keep things tidy).

Thanks for your time!
