This is a description of the output file from my script.

ID Variables
------------
* subject: subject number
* activity: activity performed by subject while wearing accelerometer, as a string

Measurement Variables
---------------------
These fields are all taken from the source data (described below), but mean-averaged across all instances of each activity for each subject. The units are unchanged from the source data (again, see below).

Samsung Galaxy S smartphone data
================================
Below is a description of the source data, which my code pulls from a Coursera-provided link before manipulating. No cleanup is necessary to this source data before running my script.

ID Variables  
------------
* subject: subject number
* activity: activity performed by subject while wearing accelerometer

Measurement Variables
---------------------

The measurement variables come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
